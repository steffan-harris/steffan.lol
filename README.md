# steffan.lol

Personal site for Steffan Harris — a single-page profile (avatar, skills, experience, links, contact) plus a small interactive playground, built with React 19, TanStack Router, and Vite.

## Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/) 19 + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) (file-based routing, codegen via `@tanstack/router-plugin`)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) with the SWC React plugin
- CSS Modules for component styling
- Deployed via Docker on Hetzner, built and pushed by GitHub Actions; reverse-proxied by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), whose config lives in the separate [server-config](https://github.com/Steffan-Harris/server-config) repo

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — type-check and build for production
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `npm run prettier-check` / `npm run prettier-write` — check or apply formatting
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally

## Changelog
